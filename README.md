### NumPy Operations Overview

#### Array Manipulation

- Transpose: Rearrange data effortlessly with `np.transpose(array)`.
- Reshape: Redefine array shapes without data loss using `np.reshape(array, shape)`.
- Resize: Dynamically adjust array size and shape with `np.resize(array, shape)`.
- Flatten: Simplify complex arrays into 1D structures with `np.flatten(array)`.

#### Array Operations

- Insert: Seamlessly integrate new elements into arrays via `np.insert(arr, obj, values, axis)`.
- Append: Expand arrays dynamically by appending elements with `np.append(arr, values, axis)`.
- Delete: Remove unwanted elements efficiently using `np.delete(arr, obj, axis)`.
- Unique: Identify unique elements within arrays using `np.unique(arr, return_index, return_inverse, return_counts)`.

#### Understanding Axes

- Master the concept of axes to perform operations along different dimensions effectively.

#### Examples and Usage
